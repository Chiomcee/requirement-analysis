### Types of Requirements

#### Functional Requirements ‚öôÔ∏è

- **Definition:** Describe what the system should do.
- **Examples:** User authentication, property search, booking system, user registration.

**Key Functional Requirements:**
   - **Search Properties:** Users should be able to search for properties based on various criteria such as location, price, and availability.
   - **User Registration:** New users should be able to create an account with personal details and login credentials.
   - **Property Listings:** Display properties with essential details and images.
   - **Booking System:** Users should be able to book properties, view booking details, and manage their bookings.
   - **User Authentication:** Secure login and registration process for users.

#### Non-functional Requirements üõ°Ô∏è

- **Definition:** Describe how the system should perform.
- **Examples:** Performance, security, scalability, usability, reliability.

**Key Non-functional Requirements:**
   - **Performance:** The system should load pages within 2 seconds and handle up to 1000 concurrent users.
   - **Security:** Ensure data encryption, secure login, and protect against common vulnerabilities.
   - **Scalability:** The system should be able to scale horizontally to handle increased traffic.
   - **Usability:** The application should have an intuitive UI/UX, making it easy for users to navigate and perform tasks.

### Use Case Diagrams

**What Are Use Case Diagrams?**

Use case diagrams are visual representations that show the interactions between users (actors) and the system. They are used to capture and define the functionality of a system from a user's perspective. The actors are external entities that interact with the system (e.g., users, administrators), while the use cases are the functionalities that the system offers to the actors.

Use case diagrams help in identifying the key functionalities and interactions of the system and provide clarity on the roles and tasks involved. These diagrams also serve as a communication tool between stakeholders and the development team.

**Benefits of Use Case Diagrams:**

- **Clear Visualization:** They provide a clear and simple visual representation of the system‚Äôs functionalities.
- **Identify User Roles:** They help in identifying various types of users and their interactions with the system.
- **Scope Clarification:** They aid in understanding and documenting the scope of the system by mapping user needs to system features.
- **Facilitate Communication:** They make it easier for non-technical stakeholders to understand the system‚Äôs functionalities.

#### **Example: Use Case Diagram for Booking System**

In this example, the use case diagram represents a **Property Booking System**, where different actors interact with the system to perform tasks like searching properties, booking a property, managing listings, etc.

**Actors:**
- **Guest:** A user who browses and searches for properties.
- **Registered User:** A user who can register, login, and book properties.
- **Admin:** A user who manages property listings, users, and system settings.

**Use Cases:**
- **Search Property:** Both guests and registered users can search for available properties based on filters (location, price, etc.).
- **Book Property:** Registered users can book a property for a given date range.
- **Login/Register:** Registered users can log in to the system or register a new account.
- **Manage Listings:** Admins can add, update, or delete property listings.

Below is the use case diagram for this booking system:

### Acceptance Criteria

**What is Acceptance Criteria?**

Acceptance Criteria are a set of conditions or requirements that a feature must meet to be considered complete and accepted by the stakeholders. These criteria serve as a formal agreement between the development team and stakeholders, ensuring that the developed feature meets the specified needs and works as expected.

**Importance of Acceptance Criteria in Requirement Analysis:**

- **Clarifies Expectations:** Acceptance criteria provide a clear understanding of the expected functionality and behavior of the system.
- **Ensures Quality:** By defining what "done" means, acceptance criteria help ensure the system meets the required standards of quality.
- **Facilitates Testing:** These criteria serve as a basis for testing. QA teams use acceptance criteria to validate that the system behaves as expected.
- **Prevents Miscommunication:** Acceptance criteria act as a contract between the stakeholders and the development team, reducing the risk of misunderstandings.
- **Guides Development:** They help developers focus on delivering exactly what is needed and avoid unnecessary features or functionality.

**How to Define Acceptance Criteria:**

- **Specific and Measurable:** Acceptance criteria must be clear and measurable to ensure that developers know exactly what to deliver.
- **Include Both Functional and Non-functional Aspects:** Criteria should cover both functional requirements (how the system should behave) and non-functional requirements (how the system should perform, such as performance and security).
- **Use Simple Language:** Criteria should be written in simple, non-technical language that all stakeholders can understand.
